The game is for two players.
The player using "0" starts the game.
Players alternate clicking on the grid cells to mark either "0" or "X".
Once a cell is clicked, it is disabled to prevent changes.
The goal is to get three of your marks (either "0" or "X") in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
Once a player wins or all cells are filled, the game ends.
